<H1> The Best Movies According to Vanessa</H1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Something From Tiffany's</h3>
<p>This is my favorite holiday movie. The setting is in New York City and has cooking, love, seeking your passions, and Christmas.
    Making it the coziest and warming movie.

<h3>You've Got Mail</h3>
<p>Great for the fall and leading into winter time. This also takes place in New York City and has an ongoing theme of books, love, and has the true essence of "Don't Judge a Book By Its Cover".</p>
<h3>Pirates of the Carribean</h3>
<p>Who doesn't love a movie that includes: pirates, fighting, love, and some comedy all in one. I just also really love Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow 
    and how he brings that character to life.
