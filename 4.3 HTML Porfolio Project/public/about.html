<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am originally from Southern California, but have been living in Phoenix, Arizona for about 8 years now. 
  My significant other of 5 years and I currently live together and have a 4 year old Australian Shepherd Mixed 
  dog named Kylo and a 1 year old cat named Kuna.
   On my free time I love to go to coffee shops, read a good book, watch a movie/show, and creating new boards on Pinterest.
   I specifically love any romantic or rom/com movies and/or books. I also love going to Disneyland and just watching anything Disney. I love breakfast foods and my coffee order is
    usually a cold brew with oat milk and vanilla or a vanilla iced latte with oatmilk.</p>

<p>I graduated college in 2020 with a degree in Sociology from Grand Canyon University in Phoenix, Arizona. I then was able to land my first job out of college at a 
  company where I was a project coordintator on a team that supported Facebook's, now Meta, contingent worker population. In 2022 I moved to a team that supports Pepsico for a great 
  growth opportunity as a Procurement Specialist level I, that supports Pepsico as a managed service provider. After being in this industry after 4 years I've decided to look into other potential career path's that I could potentially pivot to. I knew that my next job or career path I wanted to 
  move into had to involve a creative element to it, but also had to challenge me and/or allow me to use my problem-solving skills. When I brought this up to my significant other
  he mentioned I should look into front end development, as it would ecompass both of the things I was looking for as well as growth opportunity and could open
    many doors down the road. I have since been on this journey of learning and teaching myself how to do HTML and hoping to learn CSS, Javascript, and more thanks to Angela Yu!</p>

<p>I am excited to see how far this journey takes me and just to see my projects expand and evolve with me as I learn to code.</p>
